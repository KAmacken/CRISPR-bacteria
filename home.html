          <h3>About</h3>
            <p>This website is a prototype of a project proposal for the Lambert iGEM team. CRISPR and Crunchier is a viable project that focuses on using the gene-editing technology of CRISPR-cas9 and how this can be used to extract genes in antibiotic resistant bacteria and make a more affordable and easy to use solution to resistance. While this is just an idea lots of research has been conducted by college and professional labs on CRISPR and has been published online. These publications are open to everyone and some have been used in this proposal. Please refer to the works cited for these works.</p>
